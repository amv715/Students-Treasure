# Students-Treasure
The main focus of the project is on the struggle of students in college especially freshers to get acquainted with the basic functionalities of the college. This proposed system provides a helping hand to the freshers. Features like question banks, entertainment, exchange of books, discussion about clubs and chapters and a chat box for live interaction of freshers with the seniors.

It provides a compact solution to the problems faced by a fresher during the early days of college life. Coping up with the sudden change might be an easy task for some but really problematic for others. This system provides assistance to the students for the same.

The different features in this system are:

1) Chat box
2) Books exchange
3) Question paper exchange
4) Sources of entertainment(fests, restaurants)
